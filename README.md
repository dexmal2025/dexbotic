## Introduction

**Dexbotic** is a VLA (Vision-Language-Action) development toolbox built on the PyTorch framework, designed to provide a unified and efficient solution for embodied intelligence research. It comes with built-in environment configurations for various mainstream VLA models, allowing users to reproduce, fine-tune, and inference cutting-edge VLA algorithms with simple setup.

- **Ready-to-Use VLA Framework**: Centered around VLA models, integrating embodied manipulation and navigation capabilities, supporting multiple cutting-edge algorithms.
- **High-Performance Pre-trained Foundation Models**: For mainstream VLA algorithms such as π0 and CogACT, Dexbotic provides multiple optimized pre-trained models.
- **Modular Development Architecture**: Adopting a "layered configuration + factory registration + entry dispatch" architecture, users can easily modify configurations, change models, or add tasks by simply modifying experimental scripts.
- **Unified Cloud and Local Training**: Fully supports both cloud and local training needs, supporting cloud training platforms such as Alibaba Cloud and Volcano Engine, while also accommodating consumer-grade GPUs for local training.
- **Extensive Robot Compatibility**: For mainstream robots such as UR5, Franka, and ALOHA, Dexbotic provides a **unified training data format** and deployment scripts.

## Quick Start

We strongly recommend using Docker for development or deployment to get the best experience.

### 1. Installation and Environment Setup

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dexmal/dexbotic.git

# 2. Start Docker container
docker run -it --rm --gpus all --network host \
  -v $(pwd)/dexbotic:/dexbotic \
  dexmal/dexbotic \
  bash

# 3. Activate environment and install dependencies
cd /dexbotic
conda activate dexbotic
pip install -e .
```
> **System Requirements**: Ubuntu 20.04/22.04, recommended GPUs: RTX 4090, A100, or H100 (8 GPUs recommended for training, 1 GPU for deployment).

<details>
<summary>Using on Blackwell GPUs</summary>

For users with Blackwell architecture GPUs (e.g., B100, RTX 5090), please use the specialized Docker image `dexmal/dexbotic:c130t28`.

```bash
# 1. Start Docker with Blackwell image
docker run -it --rm --gpus all --network host \
  -v /path/to/dexbotic:/dexbotic \
  dexmal/dexbotic:c130t28 \
  bash

# 2. Activate environment
cd /dexbotic
pip install -e .
```
